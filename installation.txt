ProArcadeScript v1.6

INSTALLATION

I. THE SCRIPT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Unzip the package in an empty directory 

2. Upload everything located in the "Upload" folder to your server. 

3. Change files/folders attributes:

   3a. In case PHP is running as an Apache Module or you are not sure 
       how is it actually running:
     - all folders in the "content" folder: 766
     - all files in the "content/blocks" folder: 666
     - folder "docs": 766, all html files in it: 666
     - folder "include": 766
     - in the "include" folder files comments_config.php, blocks_config.php 
       pages_config.php and usersettings.php: 666
     - in the template folders (Toys, etc.) all html files : 666

   3b. If PHP is running as CGI:
     - just make sure all folders have permission level 755 and all files - 644 
       (those are default values in most ftp managers)


4. Create a new mySQL database on your server (ask your hoster if 
   you don't know how to do that), remember its name, username and 
   password, you will need all that on the next step.

5. Open www/yoursite.com/install/ in your browser and follow the 
   instructions. 

6. Once the installation process is done, remove the "install" 
   folder from the server.
